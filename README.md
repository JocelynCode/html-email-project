<h1>A dynamic and responsive email template made with only HTML and inline CSS</h1>
<p>This is the first of many demonstrations of my new favorite way to combine code and design!</p>
<br>
<p>I used a combination of HTML and inline CSS to make a responsive HTML email template that can be customized with images, gifs, and other content. I rigorously tested this template on over 80 different email providers, <strong>including Outlook!</strong></p>
<p>This template is formatted to be veiwed on mobile devices as well as, tablets, and desktops/laptops.And the feature I'm most proud of; this template works can be viewed in light mode or dark mode! This makes for a pleasant viewing experience for all users.</p>
